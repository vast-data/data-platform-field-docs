# Python Data Ingestion

While Spark provides powerful tools for large-scale data processing, the VAST Data Python Database SDK empowers you to directly query and analyze your VAST-DB tables using familiar Python syntax. This guide (refer to [here](../sdk_ref/intro.md)) will equip you with the skills to:

* **Master VAST Data Queries:** Craft efficient queries for various functionalities, from basic data retrieval to complex joins and data manipulations.
* **Build Powerful Analyses:** Explore techniques for multi-table joins with filtering and sorting to extract precise information directly from your VAST Data database.
* **Optimize for Performance:** Leverage the built-in profiling capabilities of the VAST Data SDK to understand query execution and optimize your code for maximum efficiency.
